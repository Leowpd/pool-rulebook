% Some notes:
% In diagram change "Coloured Balls" to "Object Balls" because the black is included in that portion of the diagram.
% Add a section in the appendix about playing on a table without a D and how to use the headstring instead
% also in the appendix, maybe briefly discuss that the language used is that used by our family and may not be the more standard terms.
% add "Jammy Shot" and "Jam" to glossary.
% see if you can improve how the glossary works, but it might be fine as it is for our purposes.
% a player must make a genuine attempt to escape a snooker otherwise it should be considered an intentional foul.
% make \ruleref macro so I don't need to keep using that awful hyperref line
% finish Object of the Game sections
