% Some notes:
% In diagrams change "Coloured Balls" to "Object Balls" because the black is included in that portion of the diagram.
% Add a section in the appendix about playing on a table without a D and how to use the headstring instead
% also in the appendix, maybe briefly discuss that the language used is that used by our family and may not be the more standard terms.
% see if you can improve how the glossary works, but it might be fine as it is for our purposes.
% a player must make a genuine attempt to escape a snooker otherwise it should be considered an intentional foul.
% finish Object of the Game sections
% FOUL IF THE PLAYER DOES NOT HAVE A FOOT TOUCHING THE GROUND DURING THEIR SHOT
% FOUL IF THE PLAYER ATTEMPTS TO BREAK BUT MISSES ALL BALLS AND SINKS/KNOCKS OF THE TABLE THE CUE BALL
% modify the Misleading and DistractingWhileStriking rules to suit 9-ball.
% in 9-ball general play add snooker, genuine attempt.
% in 8-ball reference the snooker section during general play
