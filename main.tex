% Some notes:

% finish Object of the Game sections

% Add a section in the appendix about playing on a table without a D and how to use the headstring instead
% also in the appendix, maybe briefly discuss that the language used is that used by our family and may not be the more standard terms.

% a player must make a genuine attempt to escape a snooker otherwise it should be considered an intentional foul.
% in 9-ball general play add snooker, genuine attempt.
% in 8-ball reference the snooker section during general play
