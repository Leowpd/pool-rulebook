      \textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition} \\ \hline
      Black, The & Alternate term for the 8-ball. \\ \hline
      Clank, The & A mishit that causes a truly angelic “clank” sound. \\ \hline
      Down Trout & Mispronunciation of “Down Trou”. \\ \hline
      If you're playing pool, you're playing pool & A phrase said to encourage a distracted player to give the game their full attention. \\ \hline
      Jammy & A lucky shot. \\ \hline
      Mishit & When the player strikes the cue ball badly. Often gives rise to \emph{The Clank}. Pronounced “miss hit”, rather than “mi-shit”.\\ \hline
      Moses & When the cue ball “parts the sea” of balls near a pocket and is the only ball that sinks. \\ \hline
      Rack 'em up! & A phrase said to the challenger to encourage them to rack the balls. \\ \hline
      Roll & Not all tables are perfectly flat, some have some deformations that can cause a change in a ball's path. This creates additional thrills and challenges for the players\dots\hspace{1mm}and often home table advantage.\\ \hline
      Tom Stick, The & The shortest cue available. Named after Tom Duncan who, at the time of coining the term, was the shortest player at the table. Tom would like it known that he is now over 6ft, and very rarely the shortest player. Recently this term has fallen out of use. \\ \hline
      White, The & Alternate term for the cue ball. \\ \hline
