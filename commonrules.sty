    Racking up the balls involves setting all \numballs\ balls up in the standard \rackshape\ formation for the opponent to break. The opponent is encouraged to make sure the rack is tight.\endgroup}
\newcommand{\DetermineWhoRacks}{Determining Who Racks: The general rule is “challenger racks,” i.e., the person who challenged their opponent racks the balls. For example, if a player says, “Do you want a game?” they are the challenger, and thus they rack the balls. This rule also extends to after each match. If a rematch is desired, the loser of the previous game is the challenger, and thus, they rack the balls.}

% === Breaking ===
\newcommand{\CueBallPlacement}{The player breaking places the cue ball in the D.}  % If playing on a table without a D, the cue ball should be placed behind the head string.  % note that including this also means that a rule needs to be added for the case when the cue ball is supposed to be behind the headstring (and also is it a common rule that in this case the player may only shoot forwards??). As we never play this rule it seems like it doesn't fit adding it to the family ruleset.

    If the player completely misses the rack on the break but the cue ball remains on the table, they may place it back in the D and have one more attempt \bracket\ provided no other ball has moved. If the cue ball sinks or bounces off the table, this is a foul and the break is handed to the opponent. A second failed attempt will also see the break handed to the opponent. In either instance, the opponent may not \specialmove.\endgroup}
