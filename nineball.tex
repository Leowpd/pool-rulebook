\section{Racking} \label{9ball:racking}

\section{Breaking \& Push Out} \label{9ball:breaking}
\ex. The player breaking places the cue ball in the D.\par
\ex. The cue ball must first strike the 1-ball. Failure to do this is a foul.\par
\ex. If the player breaking completely misses the rack but the cue ball remains on the table, they may return the cue ball to the D and have one more attempt, provided no other ball has moved. If the cue ball sinks or bounces off the table, this is a foul and the break is handed to the opponent. A second failed attempt will also see the break handed to the opponent. In either instance, the opponent may not attemmpt a Push Out [HYPERREF].\par
\ex. If the cue ball hits a rail before hitting the rack, this is a foul.\par
\ex. If the cue ball hits the rack and ends up sinking, this is a foul.\par
\ex. If any balls get knocked off the table during the break they should not be respotted on the table.\par
\ex. If the player pockets one or more object balls they may continue their turn. If they sink the 9-ball they win.\par
\ex. If the player fouls the opponent is awarded ball-in-hand [INSERT HYPERREF].\par
\ex. If the player performs a legal break and sinks no object balls, they have the option of playing a Push Out.\itemspace 
\fixedlabel{2.9.1}Here the player may attempt to move the cue ball into a preferred position.\itemspace
\fixedlabel{2.9.2}The player must state their intention to attempt a push out. It is up to the opponent if failure to do so should result in a foul.\itemspace
\fixedlabel{2.9.3}The cue ball is not required to hit any ball or rail.\itemspace
\fixedlabel{2.9.4}If the 9-ball sinks it should be returned to the table [HYPERREF].\itemspace
\fixedlabel{2.9.5}If any object ball other than the 9-ball sinks it should not be respotted but the player may not continue their turn.\itemspace
\fixedlabel{2.9.6}Any foul results in ball-in-hand as normal.\itemspace
\fixedlabel{2.9.7}Once the push out has been played the opponent may choose to either shoot from where the cue ball rests or to pass the turn back to the player.
