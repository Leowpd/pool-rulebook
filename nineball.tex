\ruleitem \TableDiagram[9ball]%

\section{Breaking \& Push Out} \label{9ball:breaking}
\ruleitem The player breaking places the cue ball in the D.%
\ruleitem The cue ball must first strike the 1-ball. Failure to do this is a foul.%
\ruleitem \CueBallMissOffBreak[9ball]%
\ruleitem \CueBallRailOffBreak%
\ruleitem \CueBallSinkOffBreak%
\ruleitem If any balls are knocked off the table during the break, this is a foul. See [INSERT HYPERREF] for returning the balls to the table.%
\ruleitem If the player fouls the opponent is awarded ball-in-hand [INSERT HYPERREF].%
\ruleitem If the player pockets one or more object balls (and does not foul) they may continue their turn. If they sink the 9-ball this is an instant win.%
\ruleitem\label{9ball:pushout}If the player performs a legal break and sinks no object balls, they have the option of playing a Push Out.%
\subruleitem Here the player may attempt to move the cue ball into a preferred position.%
\subruleitem The player must state their intention to attempt a push out. It is up to the opponent if failure to do so should result in a foul.%
\subruleitem The cue ball is not required to hit any ball or rail.%
\subruleitem If the 9-ball sinks it should be returned to the table [HYPERREF].%
\subruleitem If any object ball other than the 9-ball sinks it should not be respotted but the player may not continue their turn.%
\subruleitem Any foul results in ball-in-hand for the opponent as normal.%
\subruleitem Once the Push Out has been played the opponent may choose to either shoot from where the cue ball rests or to pass the turn back to the player.%
